# logging_app

This app is in developing. And it is made for save logs from other services.

## Why am I using such techonolgy stack?

Some people can find some of technologies choices for the logging app let's say unorthodox. To understand why you need to know the context of this app.

1. This app is created as a task from my work, where we are using the SAP services.
2. All our apps are running on SAP Kyma or SAP Cloud Foundry
3. The task was to create a free app that would run on SAP CF and can store logs for a long time
4. Another requirement was to use as a DB services that are avaible in the SAP marketplace - the only option was Postgresql

I hope now you are better understand a context of this app. And maybe some of you could use it as a base or inspiration for their projects
